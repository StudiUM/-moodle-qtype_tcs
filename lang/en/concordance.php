The LbC module of management allows you to carry out the key stages of the pedagogical scenario of a LbC.
<p>For each question to which the participant answers, an automated feedback appears, based on the answers previously given by members of a reference panel. The participant can thus:</p>
<ul>
    <li>self-calibrate by discovering how their response is compared to those of the panel;</li>
    <li>explore the reasoning of the panel members using the justifications they gave for their responses;</li>
    <li>discover educational summaries after a certain number of questions.</li>
</ul>
The LbC module of management simplifies the process of setting up an LBC which is carried out in three phases:
<ol>
    <li>Setting up an LbC</li>
    <li>Collecting responses from panelists</li>
    <li>Generating the quiz for students</li>
